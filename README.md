# Explorer
Old  Windows Explorer clone. VB.NET

This is an old project that I added just to show an example of a program that I have made.
I performed the bare-minimum maintanence just to get this code to run so that I could upload this.

This project was created for entertainment/learning purposes only, and was never finished. The GUI still has some monitoring controls as you can see, counting the number of times each control was painted up top, and other test stuff.
